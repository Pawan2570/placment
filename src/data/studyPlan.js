      selfIntro: `Good morning Sir/Ma'am,
My name is Pawan Kumar. I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Vivekananda Global University, Jaipur.

I have recently completed a 2-month internship at Linux World Informatics, where I worked on MERN Stack development and also got exposure to DevOps tools and basic AI/ML model deployment. Earlier, I also did a training internship in C++, which helped me strengthen my programming fundamentals.

I have built a few projects, including a portfolio website and an educational website named Syntax School using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also participated in a hackathon where my team's chatbot project secured a Top 5 position, which boosted my teamwork and problem-solving skills.

My technical skills include Java, Full Stack basics (HTML, CSS, JS, MERN), APIs, Git/GitHub, and Docker. Along with that, I am continuously improving my aptitude, typing speed, and communication skills to be placement ready.

I would describe myself as a motivated learner who enjoys solving problems, collaborating in a team, and applying technical knowledge to real-world projects. My career goal is to start as a software developer and gradually grow into a role where I can contribute to impactful projects in full-stack and AI-powered applications.

Thank you.`
